# Running services using `services-flake`

[services-flake][gh] is a [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/) module providing NixOS-like services for Nix flakes. It builds on top of the [process-compose-flake](/process-compose-flake) module which allows running arbitrary processes in the devShell environment.

:::caution Work in progress
`services-flake` is still being developed. Visit the [GitHub repository][gh] for more information.
